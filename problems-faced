Problem 1:
Api endpoint not working suddenly.

Recent Actions:
During Postgress + postgis installation setup aws got rebooted.
Some file permission were changed.
Some uninstalls happened & config file got changed.

So it might be changes.
Actual problem is api got running only if port is given. But in nginx proxy we already given redirection. so no need of 
explicit setting needed.

Solution:

Restarted nginx works fine
